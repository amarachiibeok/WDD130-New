            <h3 class="Vacation">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
                <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
                    You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>
                <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking 
                    scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled 
                    not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient 
                    indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>
                <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the 
                    Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety 
                    of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular 
                    I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both</p>

                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
                    the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
                    beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                    This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
                    and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and 
                    historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>

                <p>Is this a good trip for kids?</p> 
                <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that 
                    children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy 
                    it more if their children are all over 8).</p> 
                <p>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</p>
                <p> As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help 
                    ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with 
                    at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries 
                    that occur on land.</p>
